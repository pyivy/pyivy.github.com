[Code School](http://codeschool.org/) 是今天偶然发现的个人博客，内容涵盖语言基础、Python、JS、CSS，甚至还有计算机技巧，在 [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/briantwill?feature=watch) 上有大量的视频资源，画面清晰，声音有力，并通过博客发布 Intro 和 Notes，部分还公开了 PPT or PDF 讲义，非常难得的学习材料。我又 Hold 不住了。

这里列举一些我感兴趣的视频：

### the Python language

 The language Python is very close semantically to Javascript but adds more structured mechanisms for Object-Oriented Programming. Some features of the language are only discussed in the supplementary notes.

 [Lecture video (Python continued): Youtube (47 min)](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6E35733669D2FC55&feature=plcp)

 [Lecture video (Python strings and collections): Youtube (55 min)](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2DF591CFACC8FB28&feature=edit_ok)

### Server-side Web Programming

 Most web sites operate with custom code that governs the storage and presentation of their user data and content. This usually involves storing and retrieving data from a database and generating an HTML response upon each request to the server. Web frameworks facilitate these common tasks. In this unit, we cover the basics of server-side web programming and a specific web framework for Python called [web2py](http://web2py.com/).

### Unix terminals and shells

 Before graphical user interfaces, computer users interacted with the computer using a command line shell—basically, an interactive programming language in which each command the user types is immediately executed. Today, shells are tools still used by programmers and system administrators. In this unit, we’ll focus on the shell language used most commonly in Unix systems, BASH (the Bourne Again Shell). We’ll also discuss a few command-line programs commonly available on Unix systems and discuss how these programs can be tied together through the shell.

### the C language

 The C programming language is one of the oldest and most influential languages still in use today. Unlike most other languages (including Pigeon and Javascript), C gives programmers a fine degree of control over the hardware, making it suitable for writing systems software (such as operating systems, like the Linux kernel) and for programs requiring high performance, such as the latest computer games. Some features of the language are only discussed in the supplement “C continued”.

 [Lecture video (part 2): Youtube (44 min.)](http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=FBF5D9C5840A573F)

### the Java language

 Unlike Javascript and C, the Java language heavily emphasizes Object-Oriented Programming. Since the late 1990’s, Java has been the most commonly used programming language. Java’s success has spawned an imitator from Microsoft called C# (“C sharp”), which differs in many details but is fundamentally similar. We cover Java instead of C# mainly because Java is somewhat simpler and still more popular. Some features of the language are only discussed in the supplement “Java miscellany”.

### Databases

 A database is a specialized program for storing large amounts of data in a way that can be searched and retrieved efficiently. For instance, a popular website like Amazon.com uses databases to store product and customer information. The most commonly used databases are relational databases, which structure data in the style of the relational model. The programs we write typically communicate with a relational database using a query language called SQL (pronounced “sequel”, Structured Query Language).

### Numbers as bits

 How numbers are represented as bits.

 [Lecture video: Youtube (46 min.)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9yDIczflHY)

### Bits and text

 Terminology for talking about bits and discussion of how text is represented as bits.

 [Lecture video: Youtube (33 min.)](http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=383CCF1CD8313E13)

### Hardware and operating system basics

  The basic components of computer hardware and the low-level software that controls it all.

  [Lecture video: Youtube (92 min.)](http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=AF8648427BB68706)

### Programming languages

  How source code becomes a running program, how languages are categorized, and a survey of important languages.

  [Lecture video: Youtube (81 min.)](http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=7141DE955793D3F0)

### the Javascript language

  The popular language Javascript (not to be confused with Java, another popular language) is very close semantically to Pigeon, so it’s a natural choice for our first real language. Some important material is only found in the supplement “Javascript continued”.

  [Lecture video: Youtube (55 min.)](http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=92D70E98B0336AB2)

### Code practices

 A discussion of what constitutes good code and how to write good code.

 [Lecture video: Youtube (69 min.)](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL28704BC3557868CB&feature=edit_ok)

### the Internet

 How the protocols of the Internet work, including discussion of IP, UDP, TCP, ICMP, and HTTP. For background material, you may need to first watch another unit intended for a more general audience (on Youtube).

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

 Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm of programming in contrast to the more obvious “procedural” programming. Many popular languages, including Python and Java, explicitly favor the Object-Oriented style.

### Version control with Mercurial

 When we write code, it’s very nice to be able to keep track of all of our changes such that we can always go back to an earlier version when we mess something up. It’s also really important to coordinate our changes with others working on the same code. For these reasons, programmers use programs called version control systems to manage their code. We’ll focus on one such program called Mercurial.
